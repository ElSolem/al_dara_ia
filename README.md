# Polymetron’s Multidimensional Experiments & Demos

This repository collects my personal research, experiments, and demos exploring game development concepts from 2D up to 5D.

Projects here include:
- Symbolic math and harmonic engines  
- Busy Beaver Turing machine simulations  
- Dimensional shaders and rendering experiments  
- Custom data structures for higher-dimensional modeling  

The goal is to explore foundational computational and geometric ideas that could power next-gen multidimensional game engines and interactive experiences.

This is an ongoing work-in-progress, mixing art, philosophy, math, and programming.

No fluff — just raw code and concepts to spark new realities.

Feel free to explore and build on these ideas.
